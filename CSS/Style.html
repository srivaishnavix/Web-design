<!-- 10- Style tag is used for appearance and presentation, The code inside style tag is css -->
<!-- 11- Type Selector-You can add style to a specific element in style using the format
element{
    property:value;
} -->
<!-- 12- Same for p and h2-->
<!-- 13- we are styling multiple type selectors for the same property and value, 
    instead we can create same styling for multiple elements in single selector like
    e1,e2,e3{
        property:value;
    } -->

<!-- 14- style tag works, but since there will be many more styles,
     it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it. 
    Create styles.css, and rewrite the style tag content.-->
<!-- 15- Delete style tag from html, as we do styling in seperate file -->
<!-- 16- Link styles.css by
         adding link tag(self closing tag)
        with rel attribute set to value-stylesheet
        and href containing the style sheet filenamewith.css extension 
        <link- rel = stylesheet href="filname.css">-->
<!-- 17- For styling to look similar accross all devices(like phone tablet laptop and desktop)
        we need a new meta element inside head with a special content attribut-->
<!-- 18- In CSS change background colour to brown -->
<!-- 19- Change the background colour of body  to Burlywood for readability-->
<!-- 20- Div element is used for design layout purpose
        div element for contents insie body, with id attribute and menu value -->
<!-- 27- For class styling change the id attribute in div element with class attribute with value menu -->
<!-- 29- Add a article element under Coffee heading for Flavour and price; 
Article element is like an array, contains multiple elements of similar type -->
<!-- 30- Add 2 p elements the flavour and price of French vailla, and 3.00 -->
<!-- 31- Add 4 more articles with other flavours and prices -->
<!-- 32- To have flavour against the price; set a class with flavour value for the p element with french vanilla-->
<!-- 34- Add a class named price to your p element that has 3.00 as its text. -->
<!-- 36-Add class attribute to the article with the value item -->
<!-- 40- That worked, but there is still a little space on the right of the price.
You could keep trying various percentages for the widths. 
Instead, use the back space key on your keyboard to move the p 
element with the class price next to the p element with the class 
flavor so that they are on the same line in the editor. Make sure there is no space between them. -->
<!-- 42- Now add the same class with value item to all other articles -->
<!-- 43- position the other p elements of an article to be on the same line with no space -->
<!-- 44- Add applicable class names flavor and price to the p elements -->
<!-- 46- Add a new section for deserts below the coffee section -->
<!-- 47- Add a h2 element with Desserts in the new section -->
<!-- 48- Add an article with class item -->
<!-- 49- Two p elements without space on the same line : Donut and 1.50 price -->
<!-- 50- Add class of Dessert and price respectively -->
<!-- 52- Add all other items using articles and p with classes -->
<!-- 61- Add established as class to the p tag with est.2020 -->
<!-- 63- Add a footer element below the main, for additional info -->
<!-- 64- Inside the footer element, add a p tag with a tag link to freecodecamp link 
    and with the text Visit our website -->
<!-- 65- Add a second p element with 123 Freecodecamp Drive -->
<!-- 66- hr element is a divider btw sections
First, add an hr element between the p element with the class established 
and the first section element. Note that hr elements are self closing.
 -->
<!-- 67- hr element is like a line, you can change the height of the line in css -->

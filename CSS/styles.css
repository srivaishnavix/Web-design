/* 33-Use flavor class as a selector, set the text-align property's value to left. */
/* 35-Now align the text to the right for the elements with the price class. */
/* 36-Though they are arranged left and right, they are not on the same line, so we need them on same line, since p level element are block level elements-they take entire width of their parent
So we need to do styling to p for turning it into block level to inline element
Add class attribute to the article with the value item */
/* 37-To style the p elements inside the article with class name-item,have the selector as .item p{}
And have property display with value inline-block;  */
/* 38-That's closer, but the price didn't stay over on the right. 
This is because inline-block elements only take up the width of their content. To spread them out, 
add a width property to the flavor and price class selectors that have a value of 50% each. */
/* 39-Styling the p elements as inline-block and placing them on separate lines 
in the code creates an extra space to the right of the first p element, 
causing the second one to shift to the next line.
So changing it to less than 50- so 49% works */
/* 41-Now go ahead and change both the flavor and price class' widths to be 50% again. */
/* 45- If you make the width of the page preview smaller, 
you will notice at some point, some of the text on the left starts 
wrapping around to the next line. This is because the width of the p elements 
on the left side can only take up 50% of the space.
Increase flavor width to 75% and decrease width of price to 25%
 */
 /* 51- Define the selector for the dessert class, 
 as price class and flavour class exists from Coffe section but not Dessert class */
 /* 53- You can add some space between the parent edges and the menu content by using padding properties
 Give the menu class a padding-left and a padding-right with the same value 20px. 
 so much better*/
 /* 54- Now same 20px padding to top and bottom */
 /* 55- You can use a single line to add padding on all 4 sides, if the padding value is same
 Use the single padding property and delete other 4 lines */
 /* 56-Current width of menu will take 80% of the body, when the screen is too wide, the item and price are too far apart,
 So, we can use a max width to set a maximum width of 500px in menu */
 /* 57-Fontfamily of text can be changed to have different font from the browser default font.
 Few common fonts are available to the browser
 set the body font to sans-serif with font-family property */
 /* 58- make just the h1 and h2 elements different using a different selector.

Style both the h1 and the h2 elements using a single selector so that these elements' text use Impact font. */
/* 59-You can add a fallback value for the font-family by adding another font name separated by a comma. 
Fallbacks are used in instances where the initial is not found/available.
Add the fallback font serif after the Impact font. */
/* 60-Make the Est. 2020 text italicized by creating an established class selector and giving 
it the font-style property with the value italic. */
/* 62- To customize the font size of h1 and h2 seperately(as they have a clubbed selector for font
create two new seperate selectors with font size of 40 px and 30 px for h1 and h2 respectively */
/* 67- change the height property of hr element to 3px */
/* 68- Change background color of the hr to bro, to match the coffee beans */
/* 69- the edges of the hr is still grey,
Those edges are known as borders. Each side of an element can have a different color or they can all be
 the same. Make all the edges of the hr element the same color as the background of it using the 
 border-color property. */
/* 70-The default value of a property named border-width is 1px for all edges/borders of hr elements. 
By changing the border to the same color as the background, 
the total height of the line is 5px (3px plus the top and bottom border width of 1px).
Change the height property of the hr to be 2px, so the total height of it becomes 4px. */
/* 72-To create a little more room around the menu, add 20px of space on the inside of the body element
 by using the padding property. */
 /* 73- Too much line spacing for each menu item, using p selector with item class, set bottom and top margin to 5px */
 /* 74-make the font size of the items and prices larger by using a value of 18px. */
 /* 75- hr element and cinammon roll are too close compared to coffee heading and hr;
 Add some more space by creating a class named bottom-line using 25px for the margin-top property.
 */
 /* 77-Next you are going to be styling the footer element. 
 To keep the CSS organized, add a comment at the end of styles.css with the text FOOTER. */
 /* 78- Moving down to the footer element, make all the text have a value of 14px for the font size. */
 /* 79- The default color of a link that has not yet been clicked on is typically blue. 
 The default color of a link that has already been visited from a page is typically purple.
To make the footer links the same color regardless if a link has been visited, 
use a type selector for the anchor element (a) and use the value black for the color property. */
/* 80-You change properties of a link when the link has actually been visited by using a pseudo-selector that looks like 
a:visited { propertyName: propertyValue; }.
Change the color of the footer Visit our website link to be grey when a user has visited the link. */
/* 81- You change properties of a link when the mouse hovers over them by using a pseudo-selector that looks like 
a:hover { propertyName: propertyValue; }.
Change the color of the footer Visit our website link to be brown when a user hovers over it.*/
/* 82-You change properties of a link when the link is actually being clicked by using a pseudo-selector that looks like 
a:active { propertyName: propertyValue; }.
Change the color of the footer Visit our website link to be white when clicked on. */
/* 83- To keep with the same color theme you have already been using (black and brown), 
change the color for when the link is visited to black and use brown for when the link is actually clicked. */
/* 84-The menu text CAMPER CAFE has a different space from the top than the address's space at the bottom of the menu.
 This is due to the browser having some default top margin for the h1 element.
Change the top margin of the h1 element to 0 to remove all the top margin. */
/* 85- To remove some of the vertical space between the h1 element and the text Est. 2020, 
change the bottom margin of the h1 to 15px. */
/* 86- Now the top spacing looks good. The space below the address at the bottom of the menu is a little bigger than 
the space at the top of the menu and the h1 element.
To decrease the default margin space below the address p element, create a class selector named address and use the 
value 5px for the margin-bottom property. */
/* 89-The image you added is not centered horizontally like the Coffee heading above it. 
img elements are "like" inline elements.To make the image behave like heading elements (which are block-level), 
create an img type selector and use the value block for the display property 
and use the applicable margin-left and margin-right values to center it horizontally.
Tip: Use auto, to auto align it to center */
/* 91-It would be nice if the vertical space between the h2 elements and their associated icons was smaller. 
The h2 elements have default top and bottom margin space, 
so you could change the bottom margin of the h2 elements to say 0 or another number.
There is an easier way, simply add a negative top margin to the img elements to pull them up from their current positions.
Negative values are created using a - in front of the value. To complete this project, go ahead and use 
a negative top margin of 25px in the img type selector. */
